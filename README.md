# Lambda Proxy Response

Helper module for sending responses back to the [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) from [Lambda proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html) invocations.

This is a _very_ basic module. It's mainly for my own use. If you've come across this, you probably want to use [one of these other related packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=lambda%20proxy%20response) instead.

## Usage

Instructions to come.

In the meantime, you can see the [inline documentation](index.js).

## Tests

None yet!

## TODO

- Fill out this readme more
- Add more options to control the response
- Add more HTTP status code helpers, like some of the other related modules linked above
