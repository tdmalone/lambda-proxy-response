# Lambda Proxy Response

Helper module for sending responses back to the AWS API Gateway from Lambda proxy invocations.

This is a _very_ basic module. It's mainly for my own use. If you've come across this, you probably want to use [one of the other related packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=lambda%20proxy%20response).

## Usage

Instructions to come.

## Tests

None yet!

## TODO

- Fill out this readme more
- Add more options to control the response
- Add more HTTP status code helpers, like some of the other related modules linked above
